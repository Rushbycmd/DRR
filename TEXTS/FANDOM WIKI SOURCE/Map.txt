DR-Battle
Battle Area

Here you embark on your journey and defeat any dungeon that comes your way. You will begin on Rookie League Dungeons. Once completed you can move up to Gladiator League. After you have crushed the lesser dungeons you can move on to Champion League. If you manage to complete that and are still up for more there is the fourth dungeon called The Grindhouse.

So set off with your friends or like-minded allies and defeat those dungeons!

The map after Grindhouse used to say "coming soon" and it was hinted at that it would be called "Heroic League". This map has since then been released known as Ultimate Rampage Dungeons.

The gallery also called Mobs.
