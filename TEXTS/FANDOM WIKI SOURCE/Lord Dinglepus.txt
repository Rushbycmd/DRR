Lord Dinglepus

He's a King. He's your Lord. And, He's evil!

Meet the main antagonist of the game, Lord Dinglepus.

Your journey is an adventure through his dungeons, as you take part in the Dungeon Fight. You're bribed by a young girl with a chest full of riches since her outcry of her lost dog (which was eaten by henchmen number 3) didn't move your heart.

Now, you will fight your way through every beast he can throw at you. His hobby is strange and his assortment of monsters is large (he can't control all of them, however).

What awaits you at the end of this? Only one way to find out. Let the Dungeon Rampage begin!
