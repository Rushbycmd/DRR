Axes
The main weapon of the Berserker. There are different kinds of types; some are fast-paced attacking weapons, while others have a rather slow attack rate. There are even different kinds of charge attacks: a fast-hitting multi-combo attack, a heavy blow, or even an earth-shattering earthquake that swipes away enemies in a straight line.
