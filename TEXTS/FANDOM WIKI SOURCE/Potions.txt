Potions

EDIT
DR-AllBoosters
Potions are consumable items that expire upon use. They can stack up to 99. They have their own tab in the Inventory/Storage.

They come in a number of different types with different effects. Note: Boosters only effect a single run. If the dungeon is only 1 Floor and you rush through it, it is still consumed. They same can be said if it has 3 Floors.

Health Bombs
DR-ClassicHealthBombs
Health Bombs

The power of a Bomb with the restoring effects of a Health Potion. A winning combination!

These handy little items will revive you back to full health and damage all near by enemies. They will effectively give you 5 seconds of invulnerbility so you can get your revenge on those who struck you down.

There seems to be no limit on how many you can use in a single dungeon.

The only other way to avoid Defeat is to be revived by an ally or use a Health Bomb.

These come in different available amounts:

5 Health Bombs for 10 Gems
5 Health Bombs for 10 Gems
10 Health Bombs for 18 Gems
10 Health Bombs for 18 Gems
20 Health Bombs for 30 Gems
20 Health Bombs for 30 Gems
You can also gain Health Bombs from Chests.


Minor Experience Boosters

Minor Experience Boosters

Increases your experience gained by 10% for the next dungeon.

Any friend can Gift a Minor Exp Booster to you. Just make sure you send one back!

DR-MinorBoosterGift
The 10% effect is only applied at the Victory Screen and does not increase the experience gained within the dungeon. To quote that item's description: "Awarded at the end of the Dungeon".

Double Experience Boosters
These are simply the best and one of the most sotafter Boosters in the game. Although maximum level characters no longer require these. The bonus experience effect carries over to the Victory Screen and also increases the dungeon's completion experience.

These come in different available amounts:

10 2x Exp Boosters for 7 Gems
10 2x Exp Boosters for 7 Gems
30 2x Exp Boosters for 14 Gems
30 2x Exp Boosters for 14 Gems
50 2x Exp Boosters for 20 Gems
50 2x Exp Boosters for 20 Gems

Mana Boosters
DR-ClassicManaBooster
Mana Booster Potion

Increases your maximum mana by 20% for the next dungeon.

These make for a great deal of extra mana for Heroes like the Sorcerer, Ghost Samurai or even the Battle Chef. But for characters with not so high mana pools, the effect will be minor.

These come in different available amounts:

10 Mana Boosters for 15 Gems
10 Mana Boosters for 15 Gems
30 Mana Boosters for 35 Gems
30 Mana Boosters for 35 Gems
Move Speed-Up
Increases your movement speed by 50% for 30 second. This does NOT effect attack speed. The overall effect of Speed Boosters are lackluster at best. Unless you're playing Heroes with an already fairly high base speed, such as the Ghost Samurai or Ranger the additional 50% will be minor.

Maximum Equip Limit Is : 9
