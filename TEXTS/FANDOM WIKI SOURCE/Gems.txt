Gems can be obtained by opening chests, whose quantity depends on the type of chest that is opened.

Gems can also be obtained by going to the gems shop and clicking the "EARN Gems" button at the bottom of the shop. It will display several options for the player to choose to get gems. Many of these free offers include downloading apps to your smart phone or registering at a web site. Along with these methods, it was possible to get 45 Gems by connecting a Credit Card or a PayPal account to your Facebook account.

Dungeon Bucks
Before Gems were implemented, there was another premium currency called Dungeon Bucks. They had the same function as both Facebook Credits and Gems have, and they were replaced for Gems in January 4th, 2012.
