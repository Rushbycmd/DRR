Hammers
EDIT

The high-damage AoE attack of the Berserker. Multiple types of hammers exist.

DR STD HAMMER
Some create devastation in a straight line, while others damage all nearby mobs in a radius. Each one has a different advantage. The straight-line hammer provides coverage for any mini-bosses, while the area damage hammer is a great tool for keeping mobs at a distance.
