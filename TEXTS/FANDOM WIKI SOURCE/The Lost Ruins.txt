The Lost Ruins
2
EDIT
The lost ruins are famed for inspiring terror and fear in most rampagers. They were discovered long ago during the time when the monsters from Dungeon Rampage were created. The monsters and enemies in the Lost Ruins have proven to be almost as tough as those in the Grindhouse. The power of the monsters that dwell inside the Lost Ruins overwhelmed many rampagers, and many have fallen and died during battle. The Lost Ruins are open only to those who have proven their strength to conquer the Gauntlet. Only champions have defeated the dungeons of the ancient ruins.

The Lost Ruins are accessible after completing the Gauntlet, which can be found in "1-1" to "1-7." There are a total of 7 dungeons. It seems that the Ghost Samurai finds it easy to complete the dungeons of the famed Lost Ruins.
