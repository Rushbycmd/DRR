Poleaxes
EDIT
There are are two types of poleaxes.

Types of Poleaxes
Glaives
Glaives are similar to the storm spears, which can attack rapidly when holding the button. When attacking normally, the glaive attacks like a spear, except that it deals a small AOE damage on every 6th consecutive strike, leaving a small crater.

Long axes
Long axes attack similarly to glaives. However, they have different charges. When charged, a long axe will dash forward and smash the poleaxe to the ground, dealing massive damage to anyone within a certain radius.
