Extra Pet Information
The Limited Edition pet is called the Shadow Wolf, which is a variant of the Night Wolf.

There are Rare Limited Edition Pets called the Dark Dragon and the Venom Dragon, which are the variants of the Red Dragon.

All pets health are limited, as a result, they can be killed in dungeons by enemies or traps, but they will reappear after 60 seconds. Pets are a one-time purchase and all of your Heroes can travel with any of your pets.

Pets can only be on one Hero at a time. So if you wish to switch the pet to another Hero you can do so in the Storage area.

If you attempt to buy a pet that you already have, the game will have a pop-up warning notifying you that you are about to purchase a pet you already have.
