There used to be a restriction stopping you from playing as much as you could or wanted. You were required to have Keys in order to advance to the next dungeon. If you ran out of keys for the day you would have to wait. After a period of time you would've been given another key to continue your Dungeon Rampage.

These Keys had nothing to do with opening Chests but Gates instead.
