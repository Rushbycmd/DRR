Flame Staves
EDIT
Flame staves are AoE weapons used to burn enemies in front of you. They have a medium attack range (less then ranged, more then melee). All fire staves have a tap attack, no mana cost and a repeater attack.

There are two different types of them: Wide Flamestaffs and Long Flamestaffs.


Staves Types
Wide Flamestaffs
Attacks in a close range, wide spread in the direction you aim at. Hold down to attack repeatedly.

Long Flamestaffs
Attack using a thinner, but longer flame in front of you. Hold down for repeated attacks.
