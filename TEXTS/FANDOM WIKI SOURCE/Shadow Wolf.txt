The Shadow Wolf is a limited edition pet. It was originally available through an event that ended on April 16th 2012, but appeared again from August 24th to August 27th 2012. It is quoted from each event that you should get him now before he "teleports away! Who knows when he'll be back?"

He can teleport to your enemies and decimate them with his insanely powerful attacks. He can even deal massive damage to near by targets that not only knocks them back but can also obliterate your foes.

His teleport has a very familiar purple cloud while his attacks are also a purple hue. It's assumed that it's like this because of his 'Shadowy' persona.

Pros
High Attack Damage
Large AoE Knockback
Ability to Teleport
Cons
Expensive (350 gems)
