The Vorpal Bunny is an evil bunny that devours your enemy in 2 attacks.

Pros
High damage
Can't be targeted
Fast
Cons
Slow Attacks
Combat
It doesn't attack very fast, but when it does, your foe won't see the sunlight ever again! The Vorpal Bunny attacks whenever it likes. Enemies see him as no threat because of his size (and how cute he is!), so he's not targeted, but DON'T underestimate him.
